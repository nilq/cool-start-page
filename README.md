# cool-start-page

A terminal-themed startup page for browsers (only tested on Chrome).

![Screenshot](http://image.prntscr.com/image/b1ebaea2230240768a1bedb91e7fccd6.png)

Features:
	- neat DOM terminal console for google search.
	- pink
	- "folder link", a link that will open multiple links at once. (enable pop-ups to work tho).

TODO:
  - maybe some console commands.
  - maybe border shadows.
  - make nice colors.
  - load links from file 'urls.txt'


Idea and some code from: https://github.com/haothitran/launch
Instead of the original input box, it has a cool DOM terminal console.
