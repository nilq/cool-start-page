# cool-start-page

A terminal-themed startup page for Browsers (only tested on Chrome).

TODO:
  - type of link designed to open multiple windows by clicking single link.
  - maybe some console commands.
  - make nice colors.


Idea and some code from: https://github.com/haothitran/launch
Instead of the original input box, it has a cool DOM terminal console.
