# cool-start-page

A terminal-themed startup page for browsers (only tested on Chrome).

Features:
 - a neat DOM terminal console for google search.
 - pink
 - "folder link", a link that will open multiple links at once. (enable pop-ups to work tho) - also doesnt work for multiple folder links (fixing).

TODO:
  - maybe some console commands.
  - make nice colors.
  - load links from file 'urls.txt'


Idea and some code from: https://github.com/haothitran/launch (instead of the original input box, it has a cool DOM terminal console).
